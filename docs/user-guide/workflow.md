## Coffee Workflow

1. **Remove coffee pot** from the scale
   ```
   ┌────────────────┐
   │ Service ...    │
   │                │
   └────────────────┘
   ```

2. **Serve coffee** into mug(s)

3. **Return pot** to scale - system detects serving
   ```
   ┌────────────────┐
   │ 245mL - Qui ?  │
   │                │
   └────────────────┘
   ```

4. **Press person button(s)** to assign coffee

   You can click multiple persons to evenly split the mug volume.
   ```
   ┌────────────────┐
   │ 245mL - Qui ?  │
   │    A + B       │
   └────────────────┘
   ```

   !!! tip "Pre-assigning"
       You can also press button(s) up to 15s before serving coffee to pre-assign them.
       When doing so, you can still add other person(s) after service

   !!! tip "Canceling"
      If a user was added by mistake, press the red button to remove the last added user.
      To fully cancel (i.e. to not save the mug), press the red button until no more user is registered

5. **Press encoder button or simply wait** to save
